# pdf-to-omr-java

Hiya there!
This is probably a basic-ish project but very helpful! *as for me

## What does this actually do?
-> You'll provide it paths to a:
    i] PDF which has musical notations/sheet music, commonly for piano
    ii] Folder in which the images of each of the page of the PDF will go in
    iii] Folder in which the .omr and .mxl files will go

-> This program:
    i] Converts each page of the PDF into a .png
    ii] Runs a command via ProcessBuilder which scans each page and converts into a .mxl and a .omr, which then gets saved into the file path you provided
